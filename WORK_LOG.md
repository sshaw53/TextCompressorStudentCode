| Dec 2 | 9:15-10am | I spent the class time talking to my table mates trying to figure out an ideal solution to text compressor. I think the best solution I found was to store characters in 6-bit codes, the 256 most common words in the writing in 10-bit codes, and regular punctuation in 8-bit codes. I can separate these groups of readings through escape characters. |
