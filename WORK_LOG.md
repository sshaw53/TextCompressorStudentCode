I think the best solution I found was to store characters in 6-bit codes, the 256 most common words in the writing in 10-bit codes, and regular punctuation in 8-bit codes. I can separate these groups of readings through escape characters. |

I'm starting with a more simplified version where I'm only distinguishing two states, letters versus other characters. I'm working on the compressed function and having a few errors with my approach.. I'm a little worried about my tons of while loops. |

I coded the expand function as well, not sure it works at all. |

I'm worried that working with while loops won't get me to the solution I need, and tried to brainstorm other strategies on paper but based on how I want the loop to work to add minimal escape characters (only when it switches from a letter to a non letter), I think that I need to use nested while loops. Now, I'm trying to see if there's a way to break out of those loops. Currently, no solution. Maybe I could use an if statement and while loops checking a boolean instead? |

Either way, the compression ratio is too small so I tried to map out on paper how I would include a different state that represented the most common words and the mishaps I predicted to run into were overuse of .substring() and how to track the length of the word in the expand file. |

I was a little bit lost on how to search the TST only knowing the code and looking for the String associated with it, so I decided it made more sense to use an array (a map) on the expand() function. I don't think I'm compressing or expanding correctly because my compression ratio is 75% and my expansion has 722,376 bits more than it should. |
| Dec 9 |  11-11:55am   | During class, I found some bugs in my code like using "" + int to try to get a string with the character representation of the int, or using both base 10 and hex numbers as if they were all hex, etc.. One of the fundamental ideas I didn't include was to fill the trie and array with the guaranteed ASCII characters 0-255, so I made sure to do that before going through the string in the compress function or the codes in the expand function. In class, we also realized that there were some characters in the text that went out of bounds from our 0-127 ASCII codes so we had to expand to using 8-bits, which meant saving the first 256 for ASCII, and the rest for codes. But at the end of class, I was able to get through all of my errors (with the help of Mr. Blick) to complete the problem set. |
