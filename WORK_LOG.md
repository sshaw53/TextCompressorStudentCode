| Dec 2 | 9:15-10am | I spent the class time talking to my table mates trying to figure out an ideal solution to text compressor. I think the best solution I found was to store characters in 6-bit codes, the 256 most common words in the writing in 10-bit codes, and regular punctuation in 8-bit codes. I can separate these groups of readings through escape characters. |

I'm starting with a more simplified version where I'm only distinguishing two states, letters versus other characters. I'm working on the compressed function and having a few errors with my approach.. I'm a little worried about my tons of while loops. |

I coded the expand function as well, not sure it works at all. |
